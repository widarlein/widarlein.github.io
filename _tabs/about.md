Hi! This is my personal blog in which I intend to curate a bunch of posts that seem interesting to me, solutions that I want to write down to remember them, updates to any of my projects or simply ideas that I am too busy to realize.

This site is made with Jekyll and the eminent [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme, hosted on Githup Pages.
